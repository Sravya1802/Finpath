# Low-Fidelity Prototype Guide - Wizard of Oz Method

## Overview
This is a low-fidelity prototype for HCI project testing using the **Wizard of Oz** method.

## What is Wizard of Oz?
- A human (the "wizard") controls system responses behind the scenes
- Users interact with what appears to be an automated system
- The wizard manually provides responses to user actions
- This allows testing user interactions without building a full system

## Files Created

### Low-Fidelity Pages:
1. **index-lowfidelity.html** - Entry point with prototype info
2. **finpath-lowfidelity.html** - Main home page
3. **visa-selection-lowfidelity.html** - Visa selection page
4. **styles/low-fidelity.css** - Simple wireframe styling

## How to Use for Testing

### Setup:
1. Open `index-lowfidelity.html` or `finpath-lowfidelity.html` in a browser
2. The prototype uses simple black borders, basic fonts, minimal styling
3. All functionality is basic and easy to control manually

### Wizard Controls:

#### Chatbot (Wizard of Oz):
- When user sends a message, a placeholder appears: "[Wizard will type response here]"
- The wizard (researcher) can manually type responses
- Responses appear in the chat panel

#### Navigation:
- All links work normally
- Pages are simplified versions

#### Forms/Inputs:
- Basic input fields
- Wizard can manually process submissions
- Or use simple JavaScript for basic interactions

## Design Philosophy

### Low-Fidelity Features:
- ✅ Simple black borders (no gradients)
- ✅ Basic Arial font (no fancy typography)
- ✅ Minimal colors (black, white, gray)
- ✅ No shadows or animations
- ✅ Simple boxes and lines
- ✅ Wireframe appearance
- ✅ Clear prototype indicators

### Why Low-Fidelity?
- Focuses users on functionality, not aesthetics
- Faster to create and modify
- Less intimidating for users
- Easier for wizard to control
- Better for early-stage testing

## Testing Workflow

1. **Prepare:**
   - Have the prototype open in browser
   - Wizard should be ready to respond

2. **User Interaction:**
   - User navigates through pages
   - User asks questions in chatbot
   - User fills forms or clicks buttons

3. **Wizard Response:**
   - Wizard types responses in chatbot
   - Wizard can manually update page content
   - Wizard can guide user through flow

4. **Observation:**
   - Note user behavior
   - Record confusion points
   - Document interaction patterns

## Notes for Researchers

- The chatbot is designed for easy wizard control
- All pages are simplified for quick modifications
- Prototype notes are visible to remind users this is a test
- Keep interactions simple and focused

## Next Steps

To create more pages:
1. Copy existing low-fidelity HTML files
2. Use `low-fidelity.css` for styling
3. Keep design simple and basic
4. Add prototype notes where needed
